# PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. It has a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. PostgreSQL supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying.

## Running PostgreSQL with Docker

To run this PostgreSQL container using Docker, follow this:

**At same directory as docker-compose.yml write this:**

```bash
docker-compose up
```

To stop use: `ctrl + c`

The first time, Docker will automatically download the image, and subsequent times it will initialize without downloading again.
